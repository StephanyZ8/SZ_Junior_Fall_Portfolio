        <div><h1>Arcade</h1></div>
        <div><p>This project was centered around my knowledge of Python. For this project i was prompted to code several minigames that were both fun and interactive. With the use of else statements my code runs without error no matter the input of the user. The if and elifs helped me add personality and depth as the user wasn't limited to one correct answer. This project helped me understand the basics of a canvas in python, aswell as how to add text and color to it. Although this project was tedious, i was able to complete the arcade through trial and error.</p></div>

        <div><h1>Holiday Drawing</h1></div>
        <div>
          <p>
            For this project I was able to create a festive christmas scene by using Python and its SimpleGUI canvas to mimic a decorated tree, Santa Claus, colorful (animated) lights, and a holiday banner. I manipulated loops and lists to efficiently animate repeating elements like the colorful lights to make the scene more dynamic and visually interesting each time it runs. This project helped me better understand how to work with coordinates, shapes, and drawings in order to build detailed drawings with python. Although positioning everything correctly was challenging at first, adjusting my values through experimentation improved my problem solving skills and ultimately boosted confidence in coding.
